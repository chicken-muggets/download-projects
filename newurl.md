The url of this website has changed because I will soon be adding a websites page where you can find links to websites I have created therefore the url download-projects doesn't make sense as it is not just projects on that page. To find the github repository for the new website go to https://github.com/chicken-muggets/projects. The websites tab is as of writing this not deployed however I should be able to finish it by the end of the month.
